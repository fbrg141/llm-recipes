###LLM Recipes 🍳
Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I stash the LLM prompts and automations I actually use every day. These are my go-to "recipes" for making things a bit smoother, whether I'm whipping up some content or just trying to get a smart answer from an AI.

(Yes, the irony of an AI helping me write about using AI isn't lost on me. 😉)

This isn't about anything fancy—just a collection of practical stuff I've found genuinely useful. If you're looking for little tricks to kickstart ideas, speed up repetitive tasks, or just get your AI tools to really click, dive in! You might find a few things here that make your digital life a bit easier and more fun. 😊
