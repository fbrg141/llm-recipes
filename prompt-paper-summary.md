## Writing Guidelines

**Clarity & Accessibility**:
- Explain technical concepts clearly without oversimplifying
- Define domain-specific terminology when first introduced
- Use analogies or examples to illustrate complex concepts
- Maintain logical flow between sections

**Learning-Focused Content**:
- Highlight the "why" behind technical decisions, not just the "what"
- Include intuitive explanations of mathematical concepts when relevant
- Connect new ideas to established concepts in the field
- Emphasize insights that transfer to other problems or domains
- Provide real-world analogies and concrete examples to illustrate abstract concepts

**Actionable Understanding**:
- Include enough technical detail for informed discussion
- Identify key equations, algorithms, or design patterns
- Explain experimental methodology clearly enough to understand validity
- Provide context for interpreting results and claims

**Visual Elements** (when describing):
- Summarize important figures, tables, and diagrams from the paper
- Explain what visualizations demonstrate and why they're significant
- Describe architectural diagrams or flowcharts in clear prose

**Real-World Examples & Applications**:
- Provide concrete examples of how the technique could be applied in practice
- Connect abstract concepts to familiar technologies or products
- Include industry use cases or potential commercial applications
- Draw parallels to existing systems or tools readers might know
- When possible, mention specific companies, products, or platforms that could benefit from this research

## Quality Criteria

The summary should enable a reader to:
1. Understand the paper's core contribution and significance
2. Engage in informed technical discussions about the work
3. Critically evaluate the methodology and results
4. Identify connections to other research or applications
5. Assess the work's limitations and potential improvements

## Length & Format
- Target: 3-5 pages (approximately 1,500-2,500 words)
- Use clear headings and subheadings
- Write in accessible academic prose
- Balance technical accuracy with readability
- Include the paper's title, authors, and publication venue at the top
